    In this example TIM3 input clock (TIM3CLK) is set to 2 * APB1 clock (PCLK1), 
    since APB1 prescaler is different from 1.   
      TIM3CLK = 2 * PCLK1  
      PCLK1 = HCLK / 4 
      => TIM3CLK = HCLK / 2 = SystemCoreClock /2
    To get TIM3 counter clock at 10 KHz, the Prescaler is computed as following:
    Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
    Prescaler = ((SystemCoreClock /2) /10 KHz) - 1
       
    Note: 
     SystemCoreClock variable holds HCLK frequency and is defined in system_stm32f4xx.c file.
     Each time the core clock (HCLK) changes, user had to update SystemCoreClock 
     variable value. Otherwise, any configuration based on this variable will be incorrect.
     This variable is updated in three ways:
      1) by calling CMSIS function SystemCoreClockUpdate()
      2) by calling HAL API function HAL_RCC_GetSysClockFreq()
      3) each time HAL_RCC_ClockConfig() is called to configure the system clock frequency
